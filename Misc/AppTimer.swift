/** A `Publisher` disguised as an `ObservableObject`
 This hack is borne because `onReceive` is not allowed on `WindowGroup`,
 but `onChange` is, strangely.
 Hence a publisher that periodically changes a value was needed.
 This is desirable so that multiple windows are not collectively clobbering the Toggl servers with periodic requests
