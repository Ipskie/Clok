# Logging In with Your Token

### About Tokens
Your token grants access to your Toggl Track account. This allows the app to request time entries. It also allows anyone with the token to change your data, so we recommend not sharing your token with anyone else. We do not receive your token and do not store it.

### Getting Your Token
Open your [Toggl Track Profile](https://track.toggl.com/profile) (you may need to log in first), which may look like this:

![Profile Page](https://eliyap.github.io/Clok/token/profile.png)



Scroll down until you find a box labelled "API Token", which may look like this:

![Token Field](https://eliyap.github.io/Clok/token/field.png)



Copy the text in that box and paste it in the Clok token field:

hit `Enter`, and you should be all set!
