# About

### About the App
I believe in time tracking as a powerful self-analysis tool. It started with a desire to cut back on bad habits, and I’ve been running timers for over a year since.

Clok was motivated by a desire for better data visualization. Toggl, the tracker I use, is a wonderful service with a good API. However, their free (read: college student) tier lacked great graphing & analysis tools. 

I set out to make some better graphs, and ended up with an application. Hopefully it helps you to reason about your life. 

### About the Developer 
I’m Elijah Yap, a student in Los Angeles studying Computer Science. I release under the moniker SAM for uninteresting reasons.

Clok is my first application, and has been a revelatory journey into Swift & SwiftUI.

Other toy projects include
- [showcuts.app](http://showcuts.app/), a web visualizer for iOS Shortcuts
- [cheaty.org](http://cheaty.org/), a proof of concept cheat sheet generator
- many others that were quietly killed

### About Development
I chronicled development of Trickl, the project that eventually became Clok, in [Build Time](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/build-time/id1518732810).

Clok has been developed from May — September 2020.
