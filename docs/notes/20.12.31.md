# 20.12.31

### Goals

- restore auto-loading to new graph view
- allow users to manually trigger a load?
- try to fix hitching on day view
  - Instruments Hitching tool shows "pre-commit latency"
  - Tried replacing our `FetchedResults` with a raw Fetch function with set `NSPredicate`s



important notes from the WWDC hitching talks:

- offscreen renders are expensive!
- rounded corners cause offscreen renders, as do shadows, and masks
  - bad news, since I'm using rounded corners and masks extensively
- question: in the hitch profiler "Built In Display", what is "Surface 3", "Surface 5", etc? (presumably not microsoft tablets lol)



noticed something concerning in my TimeProfiler

- my functions are not labelled, it's possible that SwiftUI breaks the Time compiler
- it looks like my background indexing is causing terrible hitching and high CPU usage, despite using `performBackgroundTask`



### Changes

- Increased frequency and decreased size of indexing operations
  - causes smaller `save()` operations, so that the CPU is maxed out less, causing fewer and less severe animation hitches
  - issue caught using Hitches Instrument

---

### Planning

What should we use to suggest `TimeEntry`s?

- what most frequently comes next?
- what is this frequently previous to?
  - i.e., this rep may be highly represented in another rep's `previous`'s
  - e.g. i don't usually remember to start a "Shower" timer after "Exercise", but after "Exercise" is the only time I start a "Shower" timer
- what did you start at this time (time zone sensitve) over the last 7 days
- what did you start at this time (be time zone sensitive!) this weekday
  - this will require us to parse and store TimeZone in our model [something like this](https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/654016).



What time entry should I base suggestions off of?

- if there is a running entry, it should be that
- if there is nothing running, it should be the entry most recently ended
- if possible, I could have the NSMOC publish saves, and update "most recent"
