# 20.12.23



### Changes

##### New

- prototyped a new `UserNotification` based interaction system
  - currently, there is now a place in Settings to create test notifications
  - these test notifications allow user's to stop a timer by force pressing and hitting "Stop"
  - hopefully, this will build into a reliable feature allowing users to interact with timers directly from their lock screen



##### Bug Fixes

- fixed a bug where the discard dialog failed to appear
- small fix where running `noEntry` created a view with invalid bounds



##### Improvements

- `ExitButtons` now have the whole area clickable, not just the Text



### Misc Notes

- the above bug ("discard dialog failed to appear") seems to be have been caused by applying 2 `actionSheet`s in succession, as below:

  ```swift
  MyView()
  	.actionSheet(isPresented: $isDiscarding) { DiscardSheet }
  	.actionSheet(isPresented: $isDeleting) { DeleteSheet }
  ```

  - the solution is to apply the `actionSheet`s seperately to different parts of the view,
  - which is more appropriate anyway, since they will pop up in different places on iPadOS

- TIL about the `provisional` permissions for User Notifications
  - I'm going to try getting provisional permission on first launch, but I'm not sure if that's being a good iOS citizen.
- TIL that, if the app is open, iOS quietly hides the `UserNotification`. This took me a while to realize.

- TIL about [accessing the UIKit App Delegate](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/quick-start/swiftui/what-is-the-uiapplicationdelegateadaptor-property-wrapper) from a fully SwiftUI App
