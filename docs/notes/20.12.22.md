# 20.12.22 Build Notes

### Today's Goal

- [x] Add functionality to delete a timer

- [x] restore running timer view in calendar (previously available in `OldLineGraph`)



### Changes

##### New

- users can now delete time entries (but not running time entries, yet)

- users can now see the running time entry in the Daily Calendar view (restored after being removed in the overhaul)



##### Bug Fixes

- fixed an issue where detection inconsistencies was missed due to `escaping` closure.
- fixed a wrong field label for `billable`



##### Improvements

- used `@ScaledMetric` to make `ControlBar` icons scale with text size
  - height of control bar scales too!
  - weight of the circular stroke scales too!

- instead of hiding the save button when there are no changes, it is disabled instead

- moved the Save button down into a new pair of exit buttons

  - it is no longer "disabled" when there are no changes
  - new button is more reachable
  - both buttons are essentially identical to Toggl's, which isn't ideal, but they chose a good design which I couldn't improve on. being different for it's own sake would make the buttons less clear and less reachable.




### Misc Notes

- `@ScaledMetric` can be mixed with `static`, which is weird, but it seems that the keyword causes the property to have no effect.
- under the hood, `RunningTimeEntry` and `ProjectLite` now use `struct` + `codable` instead of `class` + `NSObject` + `NSSecureCoding`
  - TIL these are the two different ways to place items into `UserDefaults` storage
  - TIL you can mix the two together to go Color → UIColor → Data → UserDefaults storage

- I found, via trial and error, that `Color(myUIColor)` is broken, fortunately the sRGB construction works perfectly fine
  - maybe I should publish that fix as an article!
