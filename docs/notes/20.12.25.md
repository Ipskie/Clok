# 20.12.25

Merry Christmas to all!



### Planning

still no major changes, but here's the strategy I'll be adopting for indexing `TimeEntryRepresentative`:

1. set a `UserDefaults` entry called lastIndexed (type `Date`) to the current Date
2. periodically index any entries that do not have an associated Representative
3. periodically check for any entries whose `lastUpdated` is after `lastIndexed`, and re-associate them with a new `TimeEntryRepresentative`. This ensures that any changes on Toggl's end will result in our representatives being updated.



If we wish to have multiple representatives for a single entry, they will need to all be created / updated at once (otherwise the check for no associated representatives will erroneously pass)
