# 20.12.24

Today was more of a planning day.



Overarching Goal: create a simple recommendation system based on "user started this timer, then started that timer".

Plan:

1. add a one to one `TimeEntry` â‡” `TimeEntry` relationship `previous` and `next`

   - this is basically a doubly linked list

2. create a new CoreData entity: TimeEntryRepresentative

   - this "represents" a kind of abstract `TimeEntry`, it would probably have only `name` and `project` defined, possibly `tags` as well
   - this has a one to many relationship with `TimeEntry`

3. look at the TimeEntryRepresentative which represents a sizable sample of `TimeEntry`s

   - pseudocode: 

     ```swift
     myRepresentative.entries
     .map{$0.next}
     .map{$0.representative}
     // an array containing all the representatives which follow from this representative
     ```

     by aggregating similar entries in this array, we can create a crude kind of pie chart indicating which kind of entry is most likely to follow next



### Implementation Details

we do NOT need a flawless linked list for this to work.

- I expended some effort trying to ensure there were 0 mistakes in the linkage process, 
- which required re-linking when a new entry was inserted.
- this was a mistake: the only way to make sure this is flawless is to `save` after each insertion, such that all entries are available to `NSFetchRequest`
- clearly, this is incredibly inefficient



a different tack:

1. Add a field to my `TimeEntry` model: `lastIndexed`

2. Implement a background task that fires every so often (say, every 7 seconds or so)

3. it will grab the 50 or so entries that have gone the longest without being indexed, and perform the linkage process on them
